                    Windshields are an essential part of your car. They keep the wind from blowing through the car and making it difficult to drive, but they also protect you in the event of an accident. That’s why it’s so important to make sure that your windshield is in good condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a chip or crack in your windshield, it can quickly become a bigger problem. A small chip can grow until it covers the entire windshield, making it difficult or impossible to see out of. And if the chip or crack is in the driver’s line of sight, it can be hazardous to drive with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s why it’s so important to get your auto glass repaired or replaced as soon as possible if you notice any damage. The longer you wait, the bigger the problem becomes – and eventually, you may find yourself unable to drive your car.

                    Your car’s windows are made of auto glass, a type of safety glass. It is designed to shatter into small pieces instead of large shards when it breaks. This makes the window safer for you, but it also keeps you from being cut by the broken glass. If your car’s windshield or any other window is damaged, you will need to have it repaired or replaced as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately, most insurance companies will cover the cost of repairing or replacing your auto glass. However, you may have to pay a deductible before your insurance kick in. This is usually a reasonably small amount, and it is worth it to have the peace of mind that comes with knowing your windows are safe. If you are not sure whether or not your insurance policy covers auto glass repair or replacement, you can always give them a call to find out.
